This application is simple web reader, focused to every day mobile web news reading and decreasing data usage. The core is something like wrapper around Google mobile proxy and thus the web pages are without scripts, with compressed images. The app caches whole html page and offer very fast navigation to back or forward. The other advantage is ability to change font size on the fly, without touch to viewport! The app contains other intelligent features, like autoscroll to desired article on the new loaded page; browsing without images and shows them only after tap to "picture".
The app is written in Enyo 2 (openWebOS ready) framework with some webOS legacy features. The Enyo 2 is bundled with the app and it may work on any webOS device. If you like this application, you can consider donation to my homebrew Google Maps development.
